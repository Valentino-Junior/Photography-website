# Photography-website
My photography project
#### By **{Valentine Ochieng}*
## Description
{Photographic website is utilised to express emotion, touch, and love thus what you've recorded on film will often last a lifetime. On that note, this website contains list of my favourite songs with links attached to them which can enable an individual to get access to the songs. The links to the songs open on a different tab page when clicked. Moreover, the website contains images of band members with thier biography. On the biography section there is links attached that can also redirect you to the wikipedia to obtain more information about the artists.}
## Technologies Used
